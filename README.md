# CS173

This model is the velocity model used to produce CyberShake Study 17.3 in Central California.  
The model was constructed by tiling together the CCA-06, CVM-S4.26, USGS Bay Area v8.3.0, and 
the CVM-S4.26 1D model.  The minimum Vs is 900 m/s, Vp is 1600 m/s, and density is 1600 kg/m3.
Smoothing was applied within 10 km of tiling model interfaces.  The model has a resolution of 
175m and extends down to a depth of 50.4 km.
